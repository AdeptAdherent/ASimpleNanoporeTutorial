# ASimpleNanoporeTutorial

The following tutorials should be completed (in order)
1. [An introduction to logging into a server through ssh](basic_shell_logging.html)
2. [Using poreduck to package and qc fast5 data](running_poreduck.html)
3. [What we can do with our fastq data](tutorial.html)

Contrary to the title of this project, these tutorials are not as 'simple' as I'd initially hoped.
However changing the name of GitHub projects has unintended consequences so we're stuck with it,
regardless of how complex this site may become.

Each of the presentations is created with the Xargingan package of RStudio. The presentation mode can be activated by pressing 'p' whilst in the presentation. In the markdown document, anything under '???' is considered a comment and appears in the presentation mode. I would greatly appreciate any notes that people may wish to add to this project to make these presentation notes more verbose.
