# What is poreduck
.pull-left[
Two simple scripts designed to:
1. transfer data to a server.
2. Run albacore on said server.

### Before commencing this tutorial.
Please complete the basic_shell_logging tutorial.

# Installing conda on desktop (5 mins)

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
# Set the version number
anaconda_version="4.4.0"
# Download anaconda3 using the wget command
wget https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-${anaconda_version}-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
# Install anaconda. 
# -b forces install without asking questions.
# -p sets anaconda to be installed in our home directory.
bash Anaconda3-${anaconda_version}-MacOSX-x86_64.sh -b -p $HOME/anaconda3
# Now we need to update it.
conda update --all
```

---

# Creating a conda environment (10 mins)
.small[An environment is a list of settings where software versions and paths are all calibrated for a particular program or list of programs.  
However, unlike your general workspace, an environment must be 'sourced' and installations of programs into an 'environment' will not disrupt your general workspace.
]
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
PYTHON_VERSION=3.6
conda create --name poreduck_env python=${PYTHON_VERSION} anaconda
# Source the environment
source activate poreduck_env
# We will need the latest version of git.
conda install -c anaconda git -y
# And pigz
conda install -c anaconda pigz -y
# And paramiko
conda install -c anaconda paramiko -y
# Create a directory for github projects and move to this directory.
mkdir -p GitHub && cd GitHub
# Now download poreduck
git clone https://github.com/alexiswl/poreduck.git
# Now deactivate the environment, we need to edit some files.
source deactivate
```

---

# Modifying our environment.
We can further modify our conda environment so that poreduck is in our path.
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
cd $HOME/anaconda3/envs/poreduck_env
mkdir -p ./etc/conda/activate.d
mkdir -p ./etc/conda/deactivate.d
touch ./etc/conda/activate.d/env_vars.sh
touch ./etc/conda/deactivate.d/env_vars.sh
```

---

# Editing the two env_vars files.
Open up the files in textEdit or the command line and add the following to:
1. `anaconda3/envs/poreduck_env/etc/conda/activate.d/env_vars.sh`
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
#!/bin/bash
OLDPATH=$PATH
PATH=$PATH:$HOME/GitHub/poreduck
```

2. `anaconda3/envs/poreduck_env/etc/conda/deactivate.d/env_vars.sh`
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
#!/bin/bash
PATH=$OLDPATH
```

---

# Did this work?

The which command should return a link to our github file.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
source activate poreduck_env
which transfer_fast5_to_server.py
source deactivate
```

---

# Downloading some test data (10 mins)

We can use curl to download the data from cloudstor
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
curl -o poreduck_test_files.tar.gz \  
https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/index.php/s/vTbIOQdILUOgazt/download
```

Now lets move that to where MinKNOW places our runs.  
* Linux: `/var/lib/MinKNOW/data/reads`
* Mac: `/Library/MinKNOW/data/reads`
* Windows: 

`mv poreduck_test_files.tar.gz /path/to/MinKNOW/data/reads`  
`cd /path/to/MinKNOW/data/reads/`  
`tar -xf poreduck_test_files.tar.gz`  
We can now confirm by typing
`ls`
We should see two folders ending in '_TEST'

???

curl -o poreduck_test_files.tar.gz https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/index.php/s/vTbIOQdILUOgazt/download

---

# Running the transfer command
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
source activate poreduck_env
transfer_fast5_to_server.py \   
--reads_dir </path/to/reads> \ 
--server_name <your_hpc> \ 
--user_name <user_on_hpc> \   
--dest_directory </path/to/dest/on/hpc> \  
--sample_name TEST
```

### Verying success

Type the following command into the terminal.  
We should see our files zipped up nicely.
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
ssh user_name@server_name "ls -R /path/to/dest/on/hpc"
```

# Using albacore_server_scaled.py

This is a little more complex and needs to be customised to your HPC.  
At the moment this script supports both SGE and TORQUE.  

This script has no dependencies outside of conda so we don't have an issue there.  
We do have an issue however with albacore requiring python3.5 and us being on python 3.6.  

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
# SSH into our server
ssh <username>@<servername>
# Swap out python version as version 3.5 as we're now on our Linux server
PYTHON_VERSION=3.5
conda create --name albacore_env python=${PYTHON_VERSION} anaconda
# Update the conda library
conda update --all
# Download albacore
wget https://mirror.oxfordnanoportal.com/software/analysis/ont_albacore-1.2.6-cp35-cp35m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl
# Install albacore
pip install ont_albacore*.whl
# Exit environment
source deactivate
```

---

# Download poreduck
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git clone https://github.com/alexiswl/poreduck.git
# Now run the help command to see our parameters
./poreduck/albcore_server_scaled.py --help
```

---

# The template files
We have four template files, two SGE, two for PBS/Torque.  
One for each HPC type will represent a template file extraction job.  
One for each HPC type will represent a template albacore execution job.  
Let's look at these two files, unfortunately we cannot use a GUI on the server.  
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
# We can use the cat command to visualise the files.
cat poreduck/templates/qsub_templates/albacore_pbs_template.sh
```

Everything in capital letters will be replaced during the course of the run.
We just need to make sure that the script activates the albacore environment **before** running the COMMAND and then deactivates the environment once again.

---

# Running albacore_server_scaled.
Using our uploaded lambda data let's run the following:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
./poreduck/albacore_server_scaled.py \   
--reads_dir </path/to/dest/on/hpc/fast5> \ 
--qsub_type TORQUE \
--qsub_extraction_template poreduck/qsub_templates/extraction_pbs_template.sh \
--qsub_albacore_temaplte poreduck/qsub_templates/albacore_pbs_template.sh \
--sample_name TEST
```

A logging file should appear.
You can log into the hpc using another terminal window and type in the following
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
cd /path/to/dest/on/hpc/fast5
cat poreduck_logs/  # Press tab, then press enter.
```
