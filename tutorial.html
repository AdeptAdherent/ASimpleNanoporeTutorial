# Installing commandline tools (0 to 10 minutes)
Mac OSX by default does not have command line tools installed.  
This is a simple fix as shown [here](http://railsapps.github.io/xcode-command-line-tools.html)

Open up 'Terminal' and type in the following.

```bash
xcode-select -p
```

`/Applications/Apple Dev Tools/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer` shoud appear as the output.
If not, type:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

# Install anaconda3 (approx. 5 mins)
Open up terminal and type in the following lines of code.  
(Not those starting with '#', these are comments)


```bash
# Set the version number
anaconda_version="4.4.0"
# Download anaconda3 using the wget command
wget https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-${anaconda_version}-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
# Install anaconda. 
# -b forces install without asking questions.
# -p sets anaconda to be installed in our home directory.
bash Anaconda3-${anaconda_version}-MacOSX-x86_64.sh -b -p $HOME/anaconda3
# Now we need to update it.
conda update conda
# And we may need to install the latest version of git
conda install -c anaconda git -y
```

# Installing Albacore
.small[
### Linux Users:
Unfortunately, albacore is not supported by python3.6 on Linux.
Therefore we will need to create a python3.5 environment to run our basecalling software on.  
`https://mirror.oxfordnanoportal.com/software/analysis/ont_albacore-1.2.6-cp35-cp35m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl`

### Mac Users:
Albacore is supported on python3.6
Never the less we should create a separate environemnt for albacore to run on anyway.  
`https://mirror.oxfordnanoportal.com/software/analysis/ont_albacore-1.2.6-cp36-cp36m-macosx_10_11_x86_64.whl`

### Windows Users:
Like Linux, Windows Users can only use python3.5.  
`https://mirror.oxfordnanoportal.com/software/analysis/ont-albacore-1.2.6-amd64.msi`
]

???

Worth checking out that Linux distro on Windows.

# Creating a conda environment (20 mins)
An environment is a list of settings where software versions and paths are all calibrated for a particular program or list of programs. However, unlike your general workspace, an environment must be 'sourced' and installations of programs into an 'environment' will not disrupt your general workspace.

Here we show an example of creating an environment for albacore

```bash
conda create --name albacore_env python=3.6 anaconda
```

---

# Installing albacore into the conda environment 
Now we have our albacore environment, we must 'source' it.

If you can't remember the name of an environment, you can see all your installed environments using:

```bash
conda info --envs
```

Now activate this environment, and install the .whl file using pip

```bash
# Activate environment
source activate albacore_env
# Download albacore pip wheel
wget https://mirror.oxfordnanoportal.com/software/analysis/ont_albacore-1.2.6-cp36-cp36m-macosx_10_11_x86_64.whl
# Install albacore using pip
pip install ont_albacore-1.2.6-cp36-cp36m-macosx_10_11_x86_64.whl
# Decativate the albacore environment
source deactivate
```

# Installing our other tools.
It may be wise to keep albacore as its own environment, and have our other tools in a separate environment.
Albacore is quite dynamic, a with a high-frequency of upgrades.


```bash
# Create a new environment
conda create --name nanopore_tools_env python=3.6 anaconda
# Activate the environment
source activate nanopore_tools_env
```

Now let's use conda to install some tools.

---

# Installing useful nanopore tools.


```bash
# Pauvre, for viewing quality and read-length distributions.
conda install -c bioconda pauvre -y
# bwa-mem and minimap2 alignment
conda install -c bioconda bwa 
conda install minimap2 -y
# Samtools and bamtools for sorting and assessing alignments
conda install -c bioconda samtools -y
conda install -c bioconda bamtools -y
```
