# ASimpleNanoporeTutorial

The following tutorials should be completed (in order)
1. [An introduction to logging into a server through ssh](basic_ssh_logging.html)
2. [Using poreduck to transfer your data to the server and run it through albacore](running_poreduck.html)
3. [What we can do with our fastq data](tutorial.html)

Contrary to the title of this project, these tutorials are not as 'simple' as I'd initially hoped.
However changing the name of GitHub projects has unintended consequences so we're stuck with it,
regardless of how complex this site may become.
