# Installing commandline tools 
### (0 to 10 minutes)
Mac OSX by default does not have command line tools installed.  
This is a simple fix as shown [here](http://railsapps.github.io/xcode-command-line-tools.html)

Open up 'Terminal' and type in the following.

```bash
xcode-select -p
```

`/Applications/Apple Dev Tools/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer` shoud appear as the output.
If not, type:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

You will also need homebrew. Type the following line into terminal.

```bash
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

# SSH into the cluster.
Let's first try and ssh into the cluster. SSH stands for *secure shell login*


```bash
# Use your general wehi login credentials
ssh &lt;username&gt;@torquelord.hpc.wehi.edu.au
# This should prompt you for your WEHI password
```

The following commands will be needed to navigate around:  
`pwd, ls, cd`  
The following commands will be needed to move and transfer files:  
`mv, cp, rm, touch`  
You can practise these on your own computer first before trying on the server.  
Type `exit` to leave the server and return to your computer.

# Passwords are annoying.
Let's use a key so that we don't have to continue entering our password when logging in.

```bash
# Install ssh-copy-id
brew install ssh-copy-id
# Create an ssh-key
ssh-keygen -t rsa # Then press enter twice.
# Now copy ssh key to server, you will be prompted for your password, one last time
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa &lt;username&gt;@torquelord.hpc.wehi.edu.au
# Now try log in.
ssh username@torquelord.hpc.wehi.edu.au
```

---

# I can't install brew or ssh-copy-id
That's okay, we can copy our id onto the server

```bash
scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub &lt;username&gt;@torquelord.hpc.wehi.edu.au
ssh &lt;username&gt;@torquelord.hpc.wehi.edu.au
# Now we're on the server; Create a .ssh directory for the server
mkdir -p -m 600 ~/.ssh
# Now append that id_rsa.pub key to our list of authorized keys
cat id_rsa.pub &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
# Our work here is done. Let's delete the .pub file
rm id_rsa.pub
```
